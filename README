This is the original version of the README. Project's homepage doesn't exist anymore, there are also some patches in the world, but no downloadlink works.
I'll try to keep this plugin uptodate, as I like it.

This is a "plugin" for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR).

Nordlicht's EPG
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin provides an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) similar to VDR's
"What's on now?"-menu. Unlike this it also shows channels without epg-infos.
You can browse the epg with an adjustable step width. It is also possible to
set a time at the setup which you can jump to by keypress, with the keys 1-7
you can jumpo 1-7 days forward. You can enter a time to jump to instantly.
A bargraph at the "What's on now?"-view shows the progress of the running
program. Timers are marked with a clock-icon, recording timers with a 
'REC'-icon. It is possible, also for channels without epg-infos, to set and
delete timers.

Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install the plugin like any other. Additionally get the font containing the
icons (VDRSymbols.ttf) the plugins uses from

OSD setup menu.
